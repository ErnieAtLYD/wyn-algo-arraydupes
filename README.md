# Algorithm Cardio: Contain Duplicates

Given an array of integers, find if the array contains any duplicates.

Your function should return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and it should return false if every element is distinct.

Example 1:
```
Input: [1,2,3,1]
Output: true
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [1,2,3,4]
Output: false
```
Example 3:
```
Input: [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]
Output: true
```

### Hints
I can think of at least two ways to solve this problem. One way using concepts you already know, but could take a longer time to run. Remind me to go over both ways in class. :)
